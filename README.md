Features:
  - This was written using VBScript & MSHTA, so it will natively work in windows out of the box without any ****ing around.
  - Record stream from an input URL.
  - Recordings are automatically named by the model name and the date stamp in the .\recordings folder.
  - Favourites list implemented.
  - Preview stream button (so far only when selecting something in the favourites list).

  - Online / Offline models list.
  - I'll think of more later.
  
  
FAQS:
  - Q.Why VBScript and not JavaScript?
    A.I am more familiar with VBScript, but if someone wants to convert go ahead, shouldn't be too difficult.
